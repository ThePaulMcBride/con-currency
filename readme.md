#Con-Currency

This is my first attempt at a command line node.js app. I struggled to wrap my head around the concurrent style of writing code.

##Usage

Using the app is fairly straight forward. Here is an example of converting 10 GBP to USD

`node index.js 10 gbp usd`

Error handling is a little non-existent. So if you pass a value which is no a valid currency code, bad things will happen.
I'd be very keen to hear feedback!
